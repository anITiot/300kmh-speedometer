How to make a speedometer for a motorbike
I found some code on https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/diy-speedometer-using-arduino-and-processing-android-app
and that was my start for this project, I'm a newbie in programming and electronics even if I had been in the IT-world for while (at least 35 year now).......
The goal with this is to have a working easy read speedometer smallsize on the top of the fairing, I noticed that I use 2 seconds when I looked at the original speedometer lowering the head and focus on the meter, thats 50m or more travelling and I want to reduce that time for security reasons.
Next step is to add 4x7bit led display and a reliable digital hall sensor.
